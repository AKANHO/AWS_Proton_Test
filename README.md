## AWS Proton Sample CloudFormation Templates
This repository is a curated list of sample templates to use within AWS Proton that are authored for integration with AWS CloudFormation.

To use this repository, browse to the folder that corresponds to the template that you want to use. You will find there all the information you need to create environment and service templates and to deploy the corresponding environments and services. You will also find a link to a repository with basic code that runs on each one of them, in case you want to fork it to use it as the basis for your deployment.

## Registering Templates Using Template Sync
All of the Templates in this directory are set up to work with AWS Proton Template Sync. This repository is also a Template Repository. So you can click "Use this template" on the home page of this repo and that will create an identical repo in your account, which you can then use with template sync.
